Creating a desktop application (Chess Clone) using opengl and C++


## Setup
#### 1. Downloading the repository:

  -Start by cloning the repository using : `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Mehdibenhadjkhelifa/ChessClone.git`

#### 2.Configuring the dependencies:

  -Open cmd in the cloned directory.

  ~~-run this following command : `vendor\premake\premake5.exe Target`  with Target being the IDE to build for or the running system(windows/linux/ect...)~~

  ~~Example : Replace Target with vs2022 to setup for visual studio 2022~~

  -make a build directory : `mkdir build`
  
  -navigate to the build directory : `cd build`
  
  -execute cmake in the build directory:`cmake ..`
  
  NOTE:you should have cmake installed with a version of 3.5 or above
  

Now you can build the solution/project with no issues and be able to test the application

**PS**: As of now the application is still in development.
